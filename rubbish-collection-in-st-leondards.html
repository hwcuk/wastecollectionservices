To round off, I &#39;d like to leave you with a fascinating statistic: according to current research study by the Division of Environment, Food &amp; Rural Matters (DEFRA), families across England generated 22 million tonnes of waste in 2018 alone-- that suffices rubbish fill up Wembley Stadium nearly 5 times over!</p>

<p>So following time you&#39;re taking into consideration employing a rubbish collection service, bear in mind that they do greater than just &#39;eliminate our trash&#39; - they assist us shield our environment as well!</p>
