To round off, I  would love to leave you with a fascinating fact: according to current research by the Department of Environment, Food &amp; Rural Matters (DEFRA), families across England produced 22 million tonnes of waste in 2018 alone-- that&#39;s enough rubbish fill out Wembley Stadium nearly five times over!</p>

<p>So next time you&#39;re thinking about hiring a rubbish collection service, keep in mind that they do greater than just &#39;take away our trash&#39; - they assist us shield our environment too!</p>
